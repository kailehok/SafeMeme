SafeMeme Detailed Project Description

## What Is SafeMeme (SME)?

SafeMeme ($SME) is a deflationary token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20)
meaning there are virtually no gas fees and almost instantaneous swaps! This is a token that
rewards holders and punishes sellers, which can encourage a steadier price action.

SafeMeme is a community project, meaning that the community will be involved in the development of the project, each member will be able to participate in discussion and submit ideas. 

Our goal is to turn $SME into the main swap coin between new BEP20 tokens aka “meme coins”. We will list on our site safe projects that follow our rules, and we will eliminate the developers of new projects from the option of “Rug Pulling” and scamming their investors in any way. 

We believe that crypto is the financial future of the world, and our part of it, is to eliminate scams and gain the publics' trust in crypto.


### Transparency

We have an active, non-anon team on all our socials (currently Discord and Telegram - to join, check the links section on our website). We feel this is incredibly important considering how many projects get abandoned by the developers. The creator has been subject to a rug pull himself so we know how horrible it is! We truly want to try and make this project succeed along with the community. That's why we promise to be active on all current socials, to answer any questions you may have, and to enforce a strong community spirit! There is a team wallet that will be used for any costs associated with the project, for example; marketing, dev costs, exchange listing costs, etc. Everyone has the ability to see the transactions of this wallet as it is in the public domain, furthermore, we will let everyone know of any large transactions that are to be withdrawn from this wallet.


### Who Is the Founder of SafeMeme?

The founder of SafeMeme is Ilan Rakhmanov, Ilan Rakhmanov is a young entrepreneur from the U.S.. Ilan has a long history of businesses and he is in fact a self-made millionaire. Ilan owns investment real estate, vacation homes, a beauty brand, variety of private labeled brands, and he is a crypto investor for almost 8 years now. 

Here is a word from the founder: “I'm tired of seeing people trusting in Crypto and losing money on scam tokens. I'm creating a platform where people can shop for BEP20 tokens safely, restoring the trust in Crypto. ” - Ilan

With a strong & growing community standing behind SafeMeme we are sure that this project will thrive as it solves huge issues that the market currently faces.


### Where Can I Buy SafeMeme (SME)?

Currently, SafeMeme is hosting a pre-sale event on April 30th.
To avoid a pump and dump situation, the presale will be capped at 50 BNB, with a limit of only 1 BNB per person. Thanks to this plan we will avoid having whales that can dump on people if/when the price rises. We have a total supply of 1 trillion $SME and the presale rate is 1 BNB for 2 billion $SME.
