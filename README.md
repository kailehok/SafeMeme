# Welcome to SafeMeme!

A unique Rugpull-Proof utility token and exchange platform based 
on the Binance Smart Chain. We believe that Crypto is the world's financial future, 
and we're here to create a safe investing environment for BEP20 tokens.


## What Is SafeMeme (SME)?

SafeMeme ($SAFEMEME) is a deflationary token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), meaning there are virtually no gas fees and almost instantaneous swaps! This is a token that rewards holders and punishes sellers, which can encourage a steadier price action.

Our goal is to become the first Rugpull-Proof utility token and exchange platform. All tokens listed on SafeMeme.exchange will be audited and vetted, ensuring they pass the SafeMeme safety protocol. $SafeMeme will be the liquidity token for listed BEP20 tokens on our platform, increasing the stability of $SafeMeme, and increasing the tokens value for all holders. We believe that Crypto is the world's financial future, and we're here to create a safe investing environment for BEP20 tokens. 

We're creating a platform where new projects will have to be audited before they will be listed; by doing that, new investors can come onto our platform to see which new projects have passed our safety protocol. That includes contract auditing, presale & launch auditing (avoiding whales, bots, whitelisting, etc.), tokenomics auditing, creating a protocol that solely approves non-risky projects. 


### Transparency

We have a dynamic, non-anon team on all our socials (currently Discord and Telegram - to join, check the links
section on our website). We feel this is incredibly important considering how many projects get abandoned by
the developers. The creator has been subject to a rug pull himself, so we know how horrible it is!
We genuinely want to try and make this project succeed along with the community. That's why we promise to be
active on all current socials, to answer any questions you may have, and to enforce a strong community spirit!
A team wallet will be used for any costs associated with the project, for example, marketing, dev costs, exchange
listing costs, etc. Everyone can see the transactions of this wallet as it is in the public domain. Furthermore, we
will let everyone know of any significant transactions that are to be withdrawn from this wallet.
The creator is a young entrepreneur, and TikToker with 37k followers: https://www.tiktok.com/@ceoguy, more

### The Vision

SafeMeme's vision is to provide a solution to the significant issue that the market is facing right now. There are way too many
"rug pull" scams where new BEP20 tokens are being created to scam new investors or FOMO investors into scam projects.
We're building a platform where new projects will have to be audited before they will be listed; by doing that, new investors
can come onto our platform to see which new projects have passed our safety protocol. That includes contract auditing, presale & launch auditing (avoiding whales, bots, whitelisting, etc.), tokenomics auditing, creating a protocol that solely approves non-risky projects.
We're at the stage right now where we have a strong community backing us up; we already have the rules of what new
projects have to meet to pass our audit. Now we started working on developing a BEP20 token exchange platform that is
based on V2 liquidity. After that, we will begin taking applications from new BEP20 tokens; the auditing process will cost these
projects a certain amount of money distributed between all wallet holders & the dev team for salaries, expenses, etc.
Our end game: is to create a safe platform for new investors to have an additional layer of safety while investing in BEP20
tokens. While being a utility token, we are also a community-driven token that holders receive a portion of the auditing fee
and selling fee (6% total fee, 2% burn, 2% redistribution between holders, 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet. ).
To summarize: we believe that the market is firmly in need of a project like SafeMeme, and we are here to stop the BEP20
token scams and restore faith in crypto investing.

### Who Is the Founder of SafeMeme?

The founder of SafeMeme is Ilan Rakhmanov; Ilan Rakhmanov is a young entrepreneur with a long history of creating successful businesses, and he is, in fact, a self-made millionaire. Ilan owns investment real estate, vacation homes, a beauty brand, a variety of privately labeled brands, and a crypto investor for almost eight years. 

Here is a word from the founder: "I'm tired of seeing people trusting in Crypto and losing money on scam tokens. 
I'm creating a platform where people can shop for BEP20 tokens safely, restoring the trust in Crypto." 

With a strong & growing community standing behind SafeMeme, we are sure that this project will thrive 
as it solves enormous issues that the market currently faces.


### Where Can I Buy SafeMeme (SME)?

To avoid a pump and dump situation, the presale will be for approved whitelist applicants only; we will release a whitelist registration form on May 1st. Our goal is to support all of our early supporters on ourTelegram & Discord communities. Thanks to this plan, we will avoid having whales dump on people if/when the price rises, wallet cap cheaters, and bot activity.
Whitelist Registration
May 1st - May 5th: https://forms.gle/smRoZ81K1KtsnWVX8


### Presale Terms

 1,000,000,000,000 Total Supply
1 BNB = 1,000,000,000 SafeMeme
Soft Cap: 100 BNB | Hard Cap: 350 BNB | Wallet Cap: 1 BNB


### Tokenomics

We have built a token that will reward you for holding it without having to stake it manually. 
Just sit back, relax, and watch your $SafeMeme automatically increase! 

Each transaction triggers a 6% fee, where 2% is redistributed to all the current holders in proportion to their existing holdings, 
2% will be burned, decreasing the token's total supply (making it more scarce over time), and 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet.

This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is also no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt.

- 5% Dev & Crew: 50,000,000,000 - Crew & Dev Token
- 15% Treasury: 150,000,000,000 - Treasury Reserve - Platform Development, Marketing, Audits, Future Listings, Social Media Promos, Legal Fees, Business Fees.
- 20% Liquidity Lock: 200,000,000,000 - Initial Liquidity - Locked For One Year
- 35% Presale: 350,000,000,000 - Pre-Sale May 4th
- 25% Burn: 250,000,000,000 - 2% burn on launch, and 2% burn each month for 12 months.

The monthly burn will help stabilize the coin for the first year and reward those who hold long-term. This will provide enough time and stabilization to get the exchange up and running and popular enough that the token can stabilize itself and increase in price per the exchange.
